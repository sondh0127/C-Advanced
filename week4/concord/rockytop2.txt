     Wish I had a degree from Rocky Top,
     But we don't study on the HILL.
     Ain't no honor students on Rocky Top,
     Ain't no classes to fill.

     Once I had a class on Rocky Top,
     Learn't to spell dawg and kat.
     Now while I'm in jail for a robbery,
     I still think about that.

     Rocky Top, You'll never see a degree for me
     Hey ! Old ! Rocky Top !
     Now I'm a State Parolee.
     Oh how I wish I could read !

     Once two Vols went up to Rocky Top,
     Lookin' for their class on the HILL.
     Fulmer said " Hey ! We don't graduate !
     Reckon' they never will

     Mind won't grow upon old Rocky Top,
     Football is King by Far,
     That's why all the Vols from Rocky Top,
     Wind up behind prison bars !

     Rocky Top, you'll never see, a degree for me.
     Hey ! Old ! Rocky Top !
     Now I'm a State Parolee.
     Oh how I wish I could read !

     Dentists don't last too long on Rocky Top,
     mouth's too nasty by far!
     That's why all the folks on Rocky Top.
     keep their teeth in a jar !

     I've had years of schoolin' at Rocky Top,
     trapped like a duck in a pin.
     All I know is that it's a pity that,
     THE GATORS ( or insert your team name here ) JUST BEAT US AGAIN !

     Rocky Top, you'll never see, a college degree for me.
     Hey! Old ! Rocky Top ! ( WEE ! )
     Now I'm in the penitentiary.
     Played my ball for Tennessee,
     I'm still a 5th year freshmen at ut !
     YEE HAW !!!!
